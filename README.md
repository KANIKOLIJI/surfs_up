## Overview of the analysis:

In this challenge we are analyzing the weather data from oahu for the year of 2016-2017. The intention is to find out how is the weather in oahu and if it is a good place to open up a new business, which is a shake and icecream shop. We need to know how is the weather throghout the year to determine the possiblity of having customers. We are using SQLite, and SQLAlchemy to store our weather data. SQLite is a local database that will help us for easy and quick access to data. Also setting up SQLite is much easier as it is local. We are also using Visual Studio code for coding.


## Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

Month of June:
* The number of surfers is 1700.
* the average number of people per day is 74.
* min number of surfer is 64 and can go all the way up to 85 per day.


Month of December:
* The number of surfers is 1517.
* the average number of people per day is 71.
* min number of surfer is 56 and can go all the way up to 83 per day.

The numbers are fairly close given the fact that Dec can be the one of the coldest months of the year, but in oahu is a different story.
Given the min and max numbers in Dec, some days the weather is not good and some days is good, but the average numbers are so close month of June.

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

It worth to open a business in oahu base the number of surfers. The numbers showing that even in month of Dec the number of people who surf is pretty close to number of surfers in month of June. There is a slight difference and seems like oahu is a good place to surf throughout the year.
It is also recomended to determine the cost of opening a shop including the selling price. If the costs can be analyzed, and there is room to sell the products a little cheaper during the first year, then they can get loyal customers that will help to run the business in long term.
Also it is good to check the percentage of those surfers that will shop to make sure those numbers will cover the cost. It will be cost/budget analysis that can help to foreseen the obstacles.
